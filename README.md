# End-to-End Data Analytics Project (SQL + Python)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing order data using SQL and Python to extract meaningful business insights. The goal is to process, store, and analyze the data to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)
- **SQL** (Queries, Aggregations, Joins, Window Functions)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL Server**

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Collection
- Loaded dataset containing order details, customer information, and product sales.
- Extracted and transformed raw data into a structured format.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent data.
- Standardized data types for accurate analysis.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries.

### 3. Data Storage
- Stored the cleaned dataset in **SQL Server**.
- Designed an optimized database schema for efficient querying.

### 4. Data Analysis Using SQL
- Extracted key metrics such as total sales, revenue per product, and customer segmentation.
- Identified **top-selling products** and **highest revenue-generating categories**.
- Analyzed **monthly and regional sales trends**.
- Evaluated **customer purchasing patterns** and their impact on revenue.
- Used SQL functions and joins to derive insights from relational tables.

## Results & Insights
- Determined the **best-selling products and categories**.
- Identified seasonal trends affecting sales volume.
